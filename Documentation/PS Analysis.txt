PS 6 - Intrusion / Theft Detection system

An intrusion/theft detection system using IoT and AI
involves the use of various sensors and devices to
detect and alert for possible unauthorized entry or
theft in a given area or property. Using IoT and AI can
provide a high level of security and peace of mind for
property owners and managers, by leveraging the
power of advanced technology to detect and prevent
threats before they become serious.

sensors/devices such as cameras, motion sensors, etc.
3.  Use ML-based detection to reduce the number of false
positive alarms/thefts.
4.  Make use of a dashboard for real-time monitoring of their
premises
5.  Implement a way to alert authorities in time.
